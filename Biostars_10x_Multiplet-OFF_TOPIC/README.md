This doesn't directly relate to the eDNA project.

So, I apologize about the confusion.

However, I wanted to host the files for [this Biostars discussion](https://www.biostars.org/p/9467937/) somewhere that I thought would a little more robust (since the original images got blocked sometimes).

In other words, I am interested in the question of barcoding in other contexts as well.  For example, [this Biostars discussion](https://www.biostars.org/p/376585/) references analysis for this eDNA paper, but it is mostly not about eDNA samples / projects.
